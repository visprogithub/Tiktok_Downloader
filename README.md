Known Limitations and Issues

    Slideshow Videos: The downloader does not support picture slideshow videos. These will be skipped automatically.
    Failed Downloads: Some videos may fail to download due to:
        Expired download keys
        Server timeouts
        Access restrictions
        Rate limiting
    Success rate varies depending on:
        Age of the TikTok data export
        Number of videos
        Video accessibility status

Expected Behavior

    The program will:
        Skip photo/slideshow content automatically
        Report failed downloads in console
        Create progress indicators for each download
        Show final success/failure counts
    Some videos may show as "started" but fail to complete
    Failed downloads will be automatically cleaned up

Tips for Best Results

    Process your TikTok data export as soon as you receive it
    Expect some videos to fail downloading (typically 10-20%)
    Run the program multiple times for failed downloads
    Keep your original TikTok data export file as backup
    Consider requesting a fresh data export if too many failures occur

Troubleshooting Common Issues

    If majority of downloads fail, request new TikTok data export
    For timeout errors, try running program again
    Check that video links haven't expired
    Verify internet stability during downloads

Remember: This tool is designed for personal backup purposes only. Some content may be inaccessible due to TikTok's platform restrictions or expired download links.
